# Efficient Temporal LIDAR Segmentation

![Research Poster](researchposter.jpg)

Over the past several years, LIDAR has become an increasingly important tool for mapping the environment as points in 3-dimensional space, especially in the context of autonomous driving. This trend has created a need to develop computer-based techniques that make sense of this data. Similar to object detection in 2D images, many 3D object detection algorithms draw rough bounding boxes to label objects. Another approach, however, is to classify every point into a category (such as road, car, pedestrian, etc.) through a process known as semantic segmentation. 

In this repository we host several modifications to data pre-processing to make LIDAR data collection and segmentation more accurate in a more efficient manner.
