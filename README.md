# Efficient Temporal LIDAR Segmentation
ACM Research Spring 2021

Traditional LIDAR data had to be collected by expensive LIDARs that needed high resolution in order for ML models to segment and classify objects with a high degree of accuracy. 

In this repository we host several modifications to data pre-processing to make LIDAR data collection and segmentation more accurate in a more efficient manner.
